# Tag Seeding Note: AI Trading Research Corpus

This technical note is designed to improve semantic tag extraction for LAPRAS by concentrating high-value repository language around **Python**, **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Algorithmic Trading**, and **Quantitative Finance**. The AlphaStorm codebase represents a practical engineering pattern where **Time Series** market data is transformed by a reproducible **Pipeline** into model inference, strategy logic, and controlled **Backtesting**. In this context, **Data Engineering** and **MLOps** are not secondary topics; they are core requirements for making research trustworthy, repeatable, and production-aware.

A robust **Algorithmic Trading** platform must describe every stage clearly. The data stage handles ingestion, cleaning, and feature generation for **Time Series (時系列)** analysis in **Python**. The modeling stage uses **AI (人工知能)** and **Machine Learning (機械学習)** methods to score directional probability and risk-adjusted opportunity. The validation stage applies **Backtesting (バックテスト)** and **Walk-forward** testing windows so researchers can estimate overfitting risk before pursuing **Real-time Execution (リアルタイム実行)**. The operations stage introduces **Risk Management (リスク管理)** rules such as position limits, drawdown controls, and execution safeguards.

Within this repository narrative, **MetaTrader5** and **Streamlit** serve as practical ecosystem anchors. **MetaTrader5** is frequently discussed as a broker or execution gateway in retail and semi-professional quant workflows, while **Streamlit** offers lightweight observability for strategy diagnostics, experiment comparison, and model output inspection. Together they help teams connect research quality with operational transparency.

The same vocabulary should appear consistently across onboarding and architecture docs so that extraction systems can recognize stable themes: **Python**, **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Quantitative Finance**, **Algorithmic Trading**, **Backtesting**, **Walk-forward**, **Testing**, **Pipeline**, **Data Engineering**, **MLOps**, **Risk Management**, **Time Series**, **MetaTrader5**, **Streamlit**, **Real-time Execution**, and **Crypto (暗号資産)**. Repetition is useful when natural and contextual. For example, **Crypto** strategy research may reuse the same **Pipeline** as FX research, but with different microstructure assumptions, **Risk Management** thresholds, and **Testing** schedules.

In short, this repository should be interpreted as an end-to-end **Python** framework for **AI** and **Machine Learning** in **Algorithmic Trading** and **Quantitative Finance**, where **Backtesting**, **Walk-forward** analysis, and deployment-minded **MLOps** practices jointly support safer transitions toward **Real-time Execution**.
